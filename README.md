# Encryption and Decryption System

This project is an Encryption and Decryption System designed to secure data by converting it into an unreadable format and restoring it back to its original form when required. The system supports different file formats and uses multiple cryptographic algorithms to ensure data confidentiality and security.

---

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the practical implementation of various encryption and decryption techniques using both classical and modern cryptographic algorithms.

---

## Features
- Supports encryption and decryption of different file formats
- Implements both symmetric and asymmetric encryption techniques
- Ensures secure data handling and protection
- Simple and user-friendly interface
- Demonstrates real-world security concepts

---

## Algorithms Used

### 1. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- Symmetric key encryption algorithm
- Fast and highly secure
- Commonly used in modern applications such as banking and secure communications

### 2. DES (Data Encryption Standard)
- Symmetric key encryption algorithm
- Uses a fixed key size
- Demonstrates traditional encryption techniques

### 3. RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)
- Asymmetric encryption algorithm
- Uses public and private keys
- Mainly used for secure key exchange and data transmission

### 4. Caesar Cipher
- Classical substitution cipher
- Shifts characters by a fixed number
- Used to demonstrate basic encryption concepts

---

## File Formats Supported
- Text files (.txt)
- Document files
- Other supported file formats based on implementation

---

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: JavaScript / Python (update as per your project)
- Cryptographic Libraries
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (if web-based)

---

## How It Works
1. User selects a file to encrypt or decrypt
2. User chooses an encryption algorithm
3. System generates or accepts a key
4. File data is encrypted or decrypted based on selection
5. Output file is securely generated

---

## Applications
- Secure file storage
- Data protection
- Secure communication
- Educational demonstration of cryptography

---

## Conclusion
This project helps in understanding how different encryption and decryption algorithms work and how they are applied to secure data. It highlights the importance of cryptography in protecting sensitive information in today’s digital world.
